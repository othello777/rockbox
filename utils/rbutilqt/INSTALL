This is Rockbox Utility, the graphical installer and housekeeping utility
for Rockbox.

Requirements:
=============
- gcc
- Qt 5
- at least the following folders from Rockbox tree:
  o lib/rbcodec/codecs/libspeex
  o utils/
  o tools/
- libusb (Linux only)

Building:
=========
- run cmake in the utils/ folder
- run make

Build Options:
==============
There are no build options to set by the user. If your Qt installation is not
in the PATH or a standard search location you might need to set
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to point to it.

Installation / Deployment:
==========================
For deployment the generated build system contains a target
deploy_RockboxUtility (there's also a target deploy which will also deploy
other tools.) Depending on the system deployment will create a zip file
(Windows), dmg (MacOS) or AppImage (Linux).

The script utils/common/tarball-rbutil.py automates building a source archive.
For a complete list of paths to get from the repository to build please check
its source.
