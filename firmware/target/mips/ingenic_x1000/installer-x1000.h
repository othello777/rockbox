/* This API is for the bootloader recovery menu and Rockbox utility to handle
 * bootloader installation, backup, and restore.
 *
 * Currently the installer can only handle NAND flash, although the X1000 can
 * boot from NOR flash or SD/MMC. Support for other storage media can be added
 * when there is a target that needs it.
 *
 * Bootloader updates are tarballs, and they can "monkey patch" the flash in
 * a customizable way (but fixed at compile time).
 *
 * Backup and restore simply takes the range of eraseblocks touched by the
 * monkey patch and copies them to or from a regular file.
